# claude-usage-widgets

Three tiny, always-on-top desktop widgets for **Windows 10/11** that show how much Claude
headroom you have left — at a glance, with **zero installs**.

**Runs as-is — no Python, no Node, no pip, nothing to install.** Double-click and go: the
widgets use only what already ships with Windows (.NET WinForms + `curl.exe`).

**5h** &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Context** &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Combined**

![5h widget](screenshot-5h.png)

![context widget](screenshot-context.png)

![combined widget](screenshot-combined.png)

<sub>Pick one. Top: the 5-hour rate-limit. Middle: per-session context %. Bottom: both together. (Anonymized sample data.)</sub>

| Widget | Launch | Shows | Needs `.env`? |
|--------|--------|-------|---------------|
| **5h** | `cuw.bat` | The shared **5-hour rate-limit %** (and optional 7-day) | Yes |
| **Context** | `ctw.bat` | Per-session **context-window %** (how full each session's 1M window is) | No |
| **Combined** | `ccw.bat` | Both of the above in one window | Yes |

Run **one** of the three — each has its own single-instance lock, so they won't stack, but
they'd overlap on screen. Most people want **Combined** (`ccw.bat`).

## The two "walls" these track

Claude has two separate limits, and these widgets show both:

1. **5-hour rate limit** — the shared, account-wide usage pool (`5h 42% (1h58m)`). When it
   hits 100% you're paused until it resets. The widget fetches this from claude.ai.
2. **Context window** — how full *each individual session's* 1M-token context is
   (`Dev: 18% Access Claude chat… 180k * 2m`). When it fills, that session degrades / needs
   `/compact`. The widget reads this straight from the session transcript on disk.

---

## How the context number works (and why it's safe)

The context widget reads the **real token usage that Claude Code already writes** into each
session's `.jsonl` transcript (the `usage` block on every assistant turn:
`input + cache_creation + cache_read` = the true context that turn carried — the actual
tokenizer count from the API, not an estimate).

It does this by reading only the **last 64 KB** of each transcript (a byte seek, not a full
read), so it's instant even on multi-megabyte files. Crucially:

> **The context widget never runs `claude`, never forks a session, never spawns anything.**
> It only reads local files. So it cannot consume any of your 5h pool and cannot freeze.

Session **titles** (the real `/resume` picker names) load **lazily in a background thread** —
the window paints instantly with short ids, then the titles fill in (~200 ms). Nothing blocks.

> **`/compact` caveat:** right after a compaction, a session's transcript still ends with the
> *pre-compaction* peak until a few new turns land. The number self-corrects as the session
> continues. (This is why the context read stays purely local — no spawning to "fix" it.)

---

## Setup

### 1. Credentials (only for the 5h / combined widgets)

Copy [`claude_usage.env.example`](claude_usage.env.example) to
`%USERPROFILE%\.claude\claude_usage.env` and fill in three values from your logged-in
claude.ai browser session:

- `SESSION_KEY` — the `sessionKey` cookie (`sk-ant-sid01-…`)
- `ORG_ID` — your organization UUID (from any `/api/organizations/<ID>/…` request)
- `DEVICE_ID` — the `anthropic-device-id` cookie (optional but recommended)

The `.env.example` has step-by-step DevTools instructions. **The context widget (`ctw.bat`)
needs none of this** — it reads local transcripts only.

> Why `curl` and not PowerShell's `Invoke-RestMethod`? `claude.ai` is behind Cloudflare, which
> 403-challenges PowerShell's .NET TLS stack but lets `curl.exe` through.

### 2. Run

Double-click the launcher for the widget you want: **`ccw.bat`** (combined), `cuw.bat` (5h),
or `ctw.bat` (context). It appears top-right.

### 3. Optional — run at startup

<kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> → `shell:startup` → drop a shortcut to your chosen `.bat` there.

## Using the widgets

- **Drag** with the left mouse button to move (position persists per widget).
- **Left-click** (5h / combined): toggle the reset display between remaining (`1h58m`) and
  exact clock (`@14:30`).
- **Right-click** for the menu: Refresh now · Show 7d (5h/combined) · Lock position ·
  Legend / Help · Quit.

### Reading the context rows

```
● Dev: 18% Access Claude chat conte…  180k * 2m
○ mm:  48% Reorganize Python projec…  476k ~ 2h
```

- **●** touched in the last 60 s (active) · **○** idle but recently touched
- the **big %** = how full that session's 1M window is (color-gated)
- `180k` = real tokens used · `*` active / `~` idle · `2m` = since last written
- `reading` = a brand-new session with no usage block in its tail yet

**Color gates** (both the 5h and context %): green → yellow → amber → red as it fills.
Context gates are the compaction thresholds: green `<30%` · yellow `<50%` · amber `<60%` ·
red `≥60%`.

---

## Failsafes

- **`(RL)` = rate-limited.** If the 5h API returns HTTP 403, the widget keeps the **last good
  numbers**, appends `(RL)`, and retries after 60 s — it never goes blank.
- **`401 refresh .env`** — your session expired; refresh the credentials.
- **`offline` / `http NNN`** — network/server issue; keeps the last good value if it has one.
- **Off-thread fetch** — the 5h curl call runs off the UI thread, so the widget never freezes
  even on a slow network.

## "Running scripts is disabled on this system"

Windows blocks `.ps1` files by default — **you don't need to change any system setting.** The
`.vbs`/`.bat` launchers call PowerShell with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` for that **one launch
only** (no admin, nothing permanent). Always start via the **`.bat`**, not the `.ps1`.

---

## Files

| File | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| `usage-widget.ps1` + `cuw.bat`/`cuw.vbs` | 5h widget |
| `context-widget.ps1` + `ctw.bat`/`ctw.vbs` | context widget |
| `combined-widget.ps1` + `ccw.bat`/`ccw.vbs` | combined widget |
| `claude_usage.env.example` | credential template (copy → `~/.claude/claude_usage.env`) |
| `README_5h_EN.md` / `README_5h_TR.md` | deep-dive docs for the 5h widget |

Each widget runs as `powershell.exe` (no separate `.exe`). Right-click → **Quit** to close, or
match its command line (`*combined-widget.ps1*` etc.) to force-kill just that one. Launching a
`.bat` twice does nothing — a named mutex keeps a single instance.

---

## Privacy & security

- `SESSION_KEY` is a **live login token** — treat the filled-in `.env` like a password. The
  included [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) keeps `*.env` (and per-user config/cache) out of git;
  only the `.example` is tracked.
- Nothing is sent anywhere except the 5h read to `claude.ai`. The context widget makes **no
  network calls at all** — it only reads your local transcripts.
